    - Suitable for a fresher-level interview.
    - Relevant to real-world applications.
    - Commonly asked in technical interviews.
    - Concise, clear, and unambiguous.
    - Answerable within a maximum of 250 words.

    ### Output Format Requirement:
    Strictly return a valid JSON object with a key "questions", containing an array of question objects.

    #### Example Output:
    \`\`\`json
    {
      "questions": [
        { "question": "Question 1", "difficulty": "easy"},

    - answer: the answer provided by the user.
    - difficulty: the difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard).

    ### Output Format Requirement:
    Strictly return a valid JSON object with a key "evaluations", containing an array of evaluation objects. Each object should have:
    - question: the interview question.
    - correct_answer: the correct answer to the question.
    - rating: rating (1 to 10).
    - plagiarism: plagiarism percentage (0 to 100).

    Additionally, return:
    - overall_rating: an average rating across all questions.

Unlike Excel spreadsheets, databases handle large amounts of data without performance issues, support multiple users accessing data simultaneously, and ensure data integrity. They also allow for complex queries and better security, which is crucial for applications handling sensitive information.",

A foreign key, on the other hand, is a field in one table that links to the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between them. For example, in a library system, the 'Books' table may have a 'Book_ID' as the primary key. In the 'Borrowed_Books' table, the 'Book_ID' can act as a foreign key, referencing the 'Books' table to track which books are borrowed by which students.",
